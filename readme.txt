Start by setting the number of rings. More rings means higher difficulty.
Click on a stick to lift the top ring of its stack.
Click on another stick to move the selected ring to the top of its stack.
Rings may only be moved onto rings of a bigger size.
The goal is to move all the rings to the middle stick or the right stick.
The number keys 1-3 may also be used for movement.

To run:
Download the code and unzip it in a folder on your computer.
